        summary: 'Archery is one of the oldest sports still practised, developing alongside human civilisation, initially for hunting and warfare. In 1200 BC, the Hittites and Assyrians used bows and arrows on the battlefield. The first recorded archery tournaments took place in China during the Zhou dynasty (1027â€‘256 BC). In 1931 the sport evolved around the globe and an international archery federation was founded, now known as World Archery.',

The ancient Olympic Games included events such as running races and a pentathlon event that consisted of a running race, long jump, discus throw, javelin throw and wrestling. The first meets in modern times that can be likened to the athletics competitions we know today took place in 1840 in Shropshire, England. Other such championships began to thrive and spread in the 1880s, initially in England, the USA and Europe in particular. In 1912, the international federation that oversees international athletics competitions, the IAAF (now known as World Athletics) was set up.',

        summary: 'Badminton is a racket sport whose exact origins are still a tantalising mystery. It evolved from the older game of Battledor and Shuttlecock, which was a popular pastime in Europe, particularly among the affluent classes. However, it is not known exactly when Battledore and Shuttlecock transformed into the competitive sport of badminton. One plausible theory is that badminton was first played at the stately home of the Duke of Beaufort in Gloucestershire sometime in the early 1860s and thus was named after his estate, which was called Badminton House. The game travelled to India where it became a popular sport in the military cantonments. Gradually it spread in the British colonies and then to Europe and East Asia. Badminton today is a global sport with widespread appeal for people of all ages and abilities.',
